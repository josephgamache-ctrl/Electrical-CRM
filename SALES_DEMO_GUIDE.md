## 🔑 Handling Common Questions

### "How much does it cost?"

**Answer:**
> "$3,495 one-time purchase, plus $30/month for professional hosting. Compare that to ServiceTitan at $9,000-$18,000 per year, or Jobber at $708 per user per year. With your team size, you'll save $10,000-$25,000 over three years."

### "Can we try it first?"

**Answer:**
> "Absolutely. I'm setting it up now so you can use it for the next week. I'll train your team on Monday, and you can evaluate it with real jobs. If you're not happy, no obligation. But I'm confident it will save you hours every week and pay for itself in 2-3 months."

### "What if we need changes?"

**Answer:**
> "The $3,495 includes 60 days of support and minor adjustments. After that, I offer ongoing support at $99/month which includes feature updates and priority assistance. Or you can purchase additional features as one-time add-ons."

### "What if it breaks?"

**Answer:**
> "The system is hosted on enterprise-grade servers with daily automatic backups. If anything ever goes wrong, I can restore from backup within an hour. The 60-day support period covers any bugs or issues. After that, the optional $99/month support plan includes ongoing maintenance."

### "Can it integrate with QuickBooks?"

**Answer:**
> "Right now, you can export job costs and inventory to CSV, which imports into QuickBooks easily. If you need direct API integration, that would be a custom add-on we can discuss (typically $500-$1,000 for integrations)."

### "What about training?"

**Answer:**
> "Training is included. I'll spend 2-3 hours with your team on Monday showing them how to use it. It's designed to be intuitive - most people are comfortable within 30 minutes. I'll also provide written guides for reference."

### "How many users can we have?"

**Answer:**
> "Unlimited. Unlike competitors who charge $75-$150 per user per month, you pay once and add as many users as you need. If your team grows, there's no extra cost."
